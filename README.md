These are some small scripts I created for getting sane defaults after having installed Arch Linux. Probably of no interest to anyone else. ðŸ˜…

`arabic_display.sh` - By default, Wikipedia uses an Urdu font to display Arabic text. By using this script (and having the `noto-fonts-ar` package installed from the AUR), you get a coherent and readable font rendering.

`bint.sh` - For installing the Bibata Modern Ice cursor.

`swedish_locale.sh` - When you prefer having your system in English, but your locales (the way date, time and currency is presented) in an other language.
